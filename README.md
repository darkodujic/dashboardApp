# Elegant Dashboard

### Motivation

Real-life projects tend to be quite big and sometimes overwhelming, even well documented and structured ones. It can be a bit tedious when you start working on a similar one. To make this kind of transition as smooth as possible, we came up with this exercise, that will show you the whole process behind every big project, and that will get you comfortable with onboarding on every new one in the future.

### Our goal and vision

With this project, we want to show you how to configure a frontend project from scratch. As it requires setting up a lot of things, you will need to pay attention to a lot of small details and configure them that way, so they work together smoothly. Please be patient with the process, I know this is a lot to grasp at once. One thing I can guarantee you is, that in the end, it will pay off.

### Features and functionalities

This website should be (a bit) chellenging, so it is a good thing if you have some difficulties in the beggining. The designs are for desktop displays only, and we do not need adapt them to smaller (mobile and tablet) devices. It should be with React + Typescript, and feel free to use some additional libraries. Among others, your tasks will be:

- to configure and use a lot of new libraries and modules from scratch
- to build and learn how to work with multilinguistic websites
- to use a style library in JS and learn how to override libraries for your use case
- to connect and work with databases
- to use a state-management system on the frontend
- etc.

### Technical details

#### Design

You can find more details about the designs themself on the following links:

- The [free version](https://www.figma.com/community/file/984857523123277195), with accessible font sizes, spacing, color palettes, etc.
- The [full version](https://www.figma.com/community/file/981907540972983773) with images only, in order to see the whole design.

#### Server

In order to access the database, you will need to install [json-server](https://github.com/typicode/json-server) globally on your machine with the following command:

> yarn global add json-server

After a successful installation, run the database with:

> json-server db.json

### Final notes

We are always happy to help other colleagues, however, we also love proactivity and creativity, so please search for a possible solution and investigate the problem in depth before asking for help.

**Good luck and do not forget to enjoy the process! :)**
